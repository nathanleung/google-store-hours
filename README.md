Starting Creating Single Page App and using Google Places API

Outline: Demonstrating understanding in full-stack using the MEAN stack
Card/List View to display store hours.
Search view to get new places to add to list.
Db to store the places.

Quick Start:
1. mongod // To start the db
2. node server.js // To start the server

Config should look like this:

var config = {
	apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY"
};

module.exports = config;

Bugs:
Navigate to seems to be broken for certain places
